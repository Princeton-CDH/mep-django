<h2>0.3 Data Entry Improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#data-entry-improvements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Improvements to the admin interface to make data entry and content management
easier and more streamlined (particular emphasis on personography &amp; accounts).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As a global admin, I want addresses automatically associated with accounts in the logbook where possible to minimize the amount of manual cleanup required.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want to enter optional start and/or end dates for a person’s addresses so I can document when they lived there if known.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want a one-time update to set people’s gender based on titles where possible so that I don’t have to edit all the records manually.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want the end date of a subscription automatically calculated based on start date and duration, so that I can enter subscriptions more quickly.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want event duplication to be prevented so I don’t accidentally enter the same event twice.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want subscription event fields relabeled and ordered as they occur in the logbook so that I can add new subscriptions more efficiently.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want the reimbursement event form simplified so I can efficiently add new events.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want the personography list to include note previews so I can differentiate ambiguous names.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want a person’s sort name to autopopulate when I type a single name with no spaces so that I don’t have to retype it.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want an easy way to get from an account record to the associated person record so I can view and correct person details.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I need a way to distinguish people with the same name when I’m selecting a person via autocomplete.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want currency for all events to default to “Franc” so that I don’t have to set it every time.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want to edit and add new subscription categories so that I can document them as I discover them.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want to see account information when I’m editing a person record so I have enough context to make decisions and find sources.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want to see if people in the personography are in the logbooks rather than just that they have an account, because it tells me what data is available for them.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want the account list to include first and last known events dates so I can easily see membership timeline.</li>
<li>As a content editor, when I’m editing accounts I want subscription and reimbursement sections to be open by default so I don’t have to click to view membership dates.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want the event list to display type before notes so I can easily scan and differentiate events.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want project-specific data sections displayed first on the admin dashboard so I can easily get to the data I need to work with.</li>

<p>Admin functionality and data release. Provides administrative functionality for
describing and managing data related to the logbooks for Sylvia Beach’s lending
library and their associated accounts.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As a global admin, I want a one-time import of data from the logbook XML files so that I can manage lending library account and subscription information in the database.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want to see an indicator if a person has an account associated so that I can distinguish library members from others associated with the library.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want to create and edit account records so I can track how people associated with the library.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want to add and edit subscription information so I can track how and when members interacted with the library.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want to be able to view subscription events associated with an account so that I can see activity relating to an account at a glance.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want to be be able to see information about deposits refunded so that I can learn more about the habits of Beach and her clerks.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want to be able to see a listing of all events (regardless of type), so that I can look up their generic fields and any non-standard types that do not have a subcategory such as overdue notices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>0.1 Personography Admin &amp; Import<a class="headerlink" href="#personography-admin-import" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

managing data about people associated with Sylvia Beach’s lending library.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As a global admin, I want a one-time import of data from the personography XML file so that I can manage person information in the database.</li>

<li>As a content editor, I want to create and edit person records so that I can document biographical details about people associated with Sylvia Beach’s lending library.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want to add and edit professions so I can categorize people associated with the library by their work.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want to add relationships between people in the database so that I can document known associates.</li>
<li>As a content editor, when I’m viewing the list of people I want to see nationalities and number of associated addresses so I scan for records that need more data.</li>
<li>As a content editor, I want to add URLs to a person record so I can document the person’s wikipedia URL or other relevant websites.</li>
<li>As a content editor, when I edit a person and add or change the VIAF ID, I want the birth and death dates in the system populated from data available in VIAF in order to make data entry more efficient.</li>

<li>As a content editor, when I’m editing a person or address record, I want to be able to add footnotes on the same page so that I can easily document research about names and locations.</li>
