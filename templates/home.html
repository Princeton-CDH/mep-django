        In 1919, an American named Sylvia Beach opened an English-language bookshop and 
        lending library in Paris. She called it Shakespeare and Company*, and it soon 
        became the meeting place of a community of expatriate writers and artists that 
        included Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, and Ezra Pound. In 1922, 
        Beach published Joyce’s <i>Ulysses</i> under the Shakespeare and Company imprint—a feat 
        that assured the bookshop and lending library’s iconic status.</p>
        <p>
        The Shakespeare and Company Project is a digital humanities initiative that 
        recreates world of the bookshop and lending library—the world of the Lost 
        Generation, and high modernism and the avant-garde. Using two sets of records* 
        from Beach’s archives at Princeton University, the Project tracks what members 
        of the bookshop and lending library community read and where they lived. 
        The Project also captures how the community changed from the end of World War I 
        to the German Occupation of France in 1940, and the community’s connections to 
        French writers and artists—André Gide, Simone de Beauvoir, and Jacques Lacan, 
        among others—who patronized Shakespeare and Company.</p>

        What did Hemingway read after completing <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>? ⟶ What books 
        did Stein and Hemingway read in common? ⟶ Who lived in the 16th arrondissement? 
        ⟶ How did the bookshop and lending library community change after the publication 
        of <i>Ulysses</i>? After Black Tuesday? Was the community composed solely of writers 
        and artists? The Shakespeare and Company Project answers these questions and 
        many more.</p>
        <p class="footnote">
        * The Shakespeare and Company Project uses two sets of records from 
        Beach's archives to recreate the world of the bookshop and lending 
        library. Logbooks capture every book purchase, and library membership 
        and renewal, day-by-day from 1919 to 1941. Lending library cards 
        capture the addresses and borrowing histories of individual library 
        members.
